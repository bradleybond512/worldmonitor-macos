# World Monitor

Tauri 2 + TypeScript + Rust desktop app: 181+ live data panels across 4 product variants, a Cesium.js/DeckGL 3D globe with 22 geospatial layers, SGP4 orbital propagation in a Web Worker, AI summarization with Ollama/Groq/Claude/OpenRouter fallback chain, Protobuf/Buf contract-driven API layer, OS keychain secret storage, Node.js sidecar proxy on a bearer-authenticated local port, and a PostHog-instrumented Ghost Mode with analytics suppression.

## God's Eye

Full-viewport Cesium.js 3D globe mode. Activate with `G` or the sidebar.

**22 live data layers:** military bases, nuclear facilities, earthquakes, active conflicts, airstrikes, cyclones, fires, vessels, flights, cyber threats, submarines, cables, ports, satellites, ISS, and more.

**HUD overlay:** threat assessment card, mode badge, HOTSPOTS/ALT/CONFLICT/DISASTER stat pills, nearest hotspot (haversine), sun-phase badge (DAY/GOLDEN/CIVIL/NAUTICAL/ASTRO/NIGHT), local clock at camera longitude, scrolling LIVE alert ticker, top-5 alert list, layer-toggle bar.

**Fly Mode:** game-style WASD/mouse first-person flight over the globe. Right-click drag for look, scroll for speed.

**Time Machine:** scrub historical data across a configurable time window.

**Satellite tracking:** SGP4 orbital propagation in a Web Worker — ISS, Starlink, weather satellites. No API key required, TLE data from CelesTrak.

**3D buildings:** 5-tier fallback — Google Photorealistic → Cesium OSM Buildings → 2D extrusions → flat. Photorealistic requires `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

**Imagery:** Bing satellite (Cesium Ion token) → ArcGIS World Imagery fallback.

## What Makes This Hard

**Local-first desktop security boundary**
The renderer never touches API keys directly. Keys are stored in the OS keychain via Tauri's secret store, injected into a Node.js sidecar at startup, and proxied through a bearer-authenticated localhost port. The renderer resolves the sidecar port dynamically — no hardcoded assumptions about the runtime environment.

**CSP under real constraints**
`script-src` requires `'unsafe-eval'` because Cesium compiles GLSL shaders dynamically. Removing it silently breaks God's Eye (dynamic import failure → reload loop, no visible error). Compensating controls: trusted-window IPC gating, sidecar bearer auth, no `'unsafe-inline'` on script-src, devtools disabled in production builds.

**Variant architecture without forking**
Four product variants (Full, Tech, Finance, Happy) share one application shell. Panel inventory, map layer defaults, and feed configuration swap through `src/config/panels.ts` and `src/config/variant.ts` — not separate builds or conditional compilation.

**AI fallback chain**
Summarization resolves at runtime: Ollama (local) → Groq → Claude → OpenRouter → browser inference. Each hop is an explicit boundary, not a catch-all try/catch. Works in air-gapped and privacy-sensitive environments.

**App mode state machine**
Five modes (Peace/Finance/War/Disaster/Ghost) trigger on live signal thresholds — S&P ≥2.5%, ≥2 war signals above confidence 0.6 normalized by conflict baselines, GDACS Red events. Ghost Mode suppresses analytics, multiplies poll intervals ×5, and changes UI chrome. Mode transitions are deterministic and testable.

**WKWebView constraints**
CSS `-webkit-app-region: drag` is silently ignored. Window dragging requires JS `mousedown` → `tryInvokeTauri('plugin:window|start_dragging')`. All local iframes must use `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` not `localhost` — WKWebView treats them as distinct origins and the CSP only allows `127.0.0.1`.

## Architecture

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | TypeScript, Vite, MapLibre GL, deck.gl, Cesium.js, D3, i18next |
| Contracts | Buf, Protobuf, generated TypeScript clients + OpenAPI output |
| Desktop shell | Tauri v2, Rust, OS keychain, Node.js sidecar (port 46123) |
| AI layer | Ollama → Groq → Claude → OpenRouter → browser inference |
| Verification | TypeScript strict, Playwright e2e + visual, sidecar unit tests |
| CI/CD | Tag-driven desktop publish, release manifest verification, CodeQL |

## By The Numbers

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Product variants | 4 | `src/config/variant.ts` |
| Desktop build targets | 3 | `package.json` |
| Default panel inventory | 181 full / 35 tech / 31 finance / 10 happy | `src/config/panels.ts` |
| God's Eye data layers | 22 | `src/components/GodsEyeView.ts` |
| Supported secret keys | 47 | `src-tauri/src/main.rs` |
| Locales | 19 | `src/locales/` |
| Generated OpenAPI specs | 21 | `docs/api/` |

## Variants

| Variant | Web | Desktop | Focus |
|---------|-----|---------|-------|
| `full` | Yes | Yes | Geopolitics, infrastructure, cyber, conflict, disasters |
| `tech` | Yes | Yes | AI, startups, cloud, service health, developer ecosystems |
| `finance` | Yes | Yes | Markets, commodities, macro signals, central banks |
| `happy` | Yes | No | Positive news, progress, science, conservation |

## Quick Start

```bash
npm ci && npm run dev          # web, default variant
npm run dev:tech               # tech variant
npm run dev:finance            # finance variant
npm run desktop:dev            # Tauri dev build
npm run desktop:build:full     # production desktop
npm run typecheck:all          # zero-error type check
```

The `happy` variant shares the default dev server (`npm run dev`). See [docs/API_KEYS.md](docs/API_KEYS.md) for key setup and [docs/DESKTOP_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/DESKTOP_CONFIGURATION.md) for sidecar config.

## Contributing

If you change product behavior, API contracts, or operational workflows, update the docs in the same branch. The project is much easier to evaluate when the implementation and the documentation move together.
